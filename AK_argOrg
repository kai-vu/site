## Thesis title:  Orange3 Argument Mining Widget Based on a Formalism of Argumentation
*Supervisor: Atefeh Keshavarzi(a.keshavarzi.zafarghandi@vu.nl)*

In the era of data-driven decision-making, the extraction of valuable insights from data is a critical necessity. 
Formal argumentation offer a structured method for reasoning with uncertain information and conflicts. This project aims to bridge the gap between argumentation theory and data analysis and visualization by developing an argument mining widget for Orange3, an open-source data mining and machine learning software. At the end of this project, we anticipate delivering an Orange3 widget that enables users to: 1-Visualize argument structures and relationships. 2- Construct abstract argumentation frameworks and use solvers to automatically evaluate argument acceptability. 3- Provide explanations to users about the structure of arguments and the accepted arguments.
