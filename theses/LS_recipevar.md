## Recipe variation using gastronomic recipe explanations 

*Supervisor: Lise Stork (l.stork@vu.nl) and Ilaria Tiddi (i.tiddi@vu.nl)*

#### Why
Chefs constantly look for new inspirations for recipes, but discovering gastronomic patterns for interesting ingredient combinations can be challenging to do. 

#### What 
The goal of this project is to predict variations in recipes, by finding sensible gastronomic explanations for why certain ingredients go well together. 

#### How
Using the FoodKG and the structured recipes, to be found here: https://foodkg.github.io/, find walks on the graph that explain the co-occurrence of pairs of ingredients across multiple recipes. 

#### Who 
Supervision will be by Lise Stork and Ilaria Tiddi.  

#### Requirements
- Some knowledge of graphs
