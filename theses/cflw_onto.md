**The selection process for this thesis has started and we do not accept any more applications.**

#### Background:
Gaining insights starts with clear definitions. And although a lot of research has been done already on Open Source information on the Dark Web, a clear Ontology/Taxonomy is lacking in this domain. Some research has been done, for example: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2021.102258">link</a>. But more is needed to come to a well-defined way to classify the dark web which is needed to streamline collaboration and interoperability of systems.

#### Description:
Recently CFLW has begun the development of the Dark Web Ontology. This thesis research would be to solidify this draft and develop it into a solid foundation for the community to use.

#### Tasks:
1. What are ontology engineering best practices?
2. How can the ontology be shared according to standards?
3. How can the Dark Web Ontology of CFLW be improved?

**Research Question:** Are state-of-the-art ontology engineering principles applicable in the domain of the dark web?
