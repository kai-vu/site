## A Tool for Publishing Social Inequality Hypotheses

*Supervisor: Lise Stork (l.stork@vu.nl)*


#### Why 
Transparency and clarity of theories on which we build is paramount. Natural language cannot carry truth unambiguously, but scientific discoveries are commonly described, albeit with academic language, in natural language in scientific articles. The formalisation of social history hypotheses can advance the domain: it facilitates transparency (e.g., for reproducibility), it can help highlight bias, as well as theory synthesis and thereby the revision, consolidation and the unification of known theories.

#### What 
Creation of a simple web interface for the authoring of research papers on inequality, evaluated through a user evaluation study. 

#### How 
Using an (existing) ontology for social history hypotheses, the student should create a simple web application allowing social historians to turn their research questions into structured hypotheses (structured in the form of triples of the form <subject><predicate><object>, using the Resource Description Framework (RDF)). The student will run a user study to measure the effectiveness and usability of the tool, as well as the resulting knowledge graph. 

#### Who 
The supervisor of this project will be Lise Stork.
