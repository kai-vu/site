## Explaining query answers in prioritized databases 

*Supervisor: Loan Ho (t.t.l.ho@vu.nl)*


#### Why 
Explanation for query answers in databases has paid attention recently when dealing with inconsistent database. In particular, we consider universal constraints, for example, in a hospital setting, a universal constraint can be used to capture expert knowledge that a patient cannot receive a certain treatment without a positive test for a given mutation, with violations indicating either an erroneous treatment record or missing test result. In this case, finding the root causes for this inconsistentcy is a challenge during query answering. 
#### What 
In this project, we will use logic-based argumentation to provide explanation of how the query answer was reached.
#### Who 
Supervision will be by Loan Ho and Stefan Schlobach. 

#### Requirements
- Knowledge of knowledge graph

#### Literature
- Bienvenu et.al "Query inconsistent prioritized data with ORBITS: Algorithms, implementation, ans experiments". 2022
