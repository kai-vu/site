## Computing extensions for argumentation with collective attacks (Bsc) 

*Supervisor: Loan Ho (t.t.l.ho@vu.nl)*


#### Why 
SETAFs as introduced by Nielsen and Parsons are a generalization of Dung AFs which generalize the binary attacks in Dung AFs to collective attacks. Computational properties of SETAFs have been neglected so far. This project will focus on building a tool for computing these properties of SETAFs.
#### How 
In this thesis, we will build a tool to calculate extensions for argumentation with collective attacks. The inputs are a set of arguments and collective attacks. The output returns different (stable, preferred, complete, grounded) extensions 
#### Who 
Supervision will be by Loan Ho and Stefan Schlobach. 

#### Requirements
- Knowledge of programming (prefer to Java)
