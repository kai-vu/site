## Semantic Annotation of Inequality Literature

*Supervisor: Lise Stork (l.stork@vu.nl)*


#### Why 
Transparency and clarity of theories on which we build is paramount. Natural language cannot carry truth unambiguously, but scientific discoveries are commonly described, albeit with academic language, in natural language in scientific articles. The formalisation of social history hypotheses advances research: it facilitates transparency (e.g., for reproducibility), it can help highlight bias, as well as theory synthesis and thereby the revision, consolidation and the unification of known theories.

#### What 
Creation of a simple web interface for the semantic annotation of research papers on inequality plus a user evaluation study. 

#### How 
Using an ontology for social history hypotheses, the student should create a simple web application which allows social historians to turn their research papers into structured hypotheses. The student will run a user study to measure the effectiveness and usability of the tool, as well as the resulting knowledge graph. 

#### Who 
supervision will be by Lise Stork. We will collaborate with Richard Zijdemans from the International Institute for Social History (IISH). https://iisg.amsterdam/en

#### Requirements
- Some knowledge of graphs

#### Literature
- TLogic: Temporal Logical Rules for Explainable Link Forecasting on Temporal Knowledge Graphs. [paper]
