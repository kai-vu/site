## Visual scene understanding for indoor mobile robots 

*Supervisor: Mark Adamik (m.adamik@vu.nl), Ilaria Tiddi (i.tiddi@vu.nl)*

#### Why
Pollution is one of the greatest challenges of our time. It is however a task that is both unpleasant and potentially dangerous for humans to perform (especially when the waste is contaminated), therefore an automated robotic solution is highly desired. A solution could be using a mobile robot equipped with a manipulator and to integrate knowledge representation and reasoning methods over the potential categories of trash, for example:
Differentiate between trash and non-trash (what are the most likely waste in an office environment?)
Reason over the qualities of the object (e.g. a bottle that is transparent and light is usually made of plastic, whereas a heavy one might be glass)


#### What 
n this project, you will be using the LoCoBot, a mobile robot equipped with multiple sensors and a manipulator. Your task would be to integrate object recognition methods (e.g. YOLO) and knowledge representation & reasoning methods to solve pick and place problems representing trash collection.

#### How
1. A literature review on the state-of-the-art methods integrating knowledge representation and reasoning with mobile robotics
2. Familiarizing with the LoCoBot platform and ROS.
3. Build a knowledge graph depending on the chosen use-case
4. Developing an integrated robot control system that is able to recognize and reason over objects.


#### Who 
Supervision will be by Mark Adamik and Ilaria Tiddi.  

#### Requirements
- Some knowledge of graphs
- Knowledge of Robotic Operating System (ROS) is a nice to have, willingness to learn it is a must
- Image processing techniques is a nice to have but not essential
