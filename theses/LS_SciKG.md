## Scientific Discovery and Knowledge Graphs

Hypotheses generation and testing in scientific research is often a time-intensive process, depending on the precise execution of a few steps that are similar within (and sometimes across) research domains. Researchers are now looking into how to make the process more reproducible, with the end goal of machine actionability – the ability of machines to discover knowledge with no or little human intervention. 

#### What 
For this project, a MSc. student can focus on addressing one (or more) of the steps of hypothesis generation and testing for humanities or social science research (e.g., demographic research on health inequality, or scientific discovery in biodiversity heritage): 

##### Step (project) 1: Dealing with observational data (as RDF Data Cubes): 

https://www.who.int/data/inequality-monitor/data

- mapping tabular observational data (such as census data) to RDF data cubes
- data and knowledge integration (discovering bias, automatically discovering ‘content gaps’) 

Relevant literature: 

##### Step (project) 2: Automatically discovering interesting patterns (descriptive statistics) and their comparisons in RDF Data Cubes:  

- automated discovery of interesting aggregations (descriptive statistics) of observational data (RDF Data cubes)
- automated discovery of interesting comparsisons of statistics
  
Relevant literature: 

##### Step (project) 3: Describing components of theories, and formalising theories from the literature
- n-ary relation extraction from articles (human in the loop workflows?)
- integration of theories with other domains or other knowledge on the Web 
- representation of theories/research questions (modeling) 
- SHACL-forms: creating a user form from SHACL shapes for publishing structured research questions as RDF, and testing such an interface in a user study
  
Relevant literature: 

##### Step (project) 4: Understanding (and towards automation of) the scientific process, 
- research how process ontologies of the scientific cycle can aid researchers
- a comparison of all (RDF) vocabularies for describing the scientific process (supervisors: Lise & Ilaria) 
- a comparison of human-in-the-loop workflows of the scientific cycle that make use of Knowledge Graphs 

Relevant literature: 

##### Project 5: general hypothesis testing: 

- hypothesis testing as question answering over RDF data cubes 

#### Requirements
- Experience with Knowledge Graphs  _recommended_

#### Literature
