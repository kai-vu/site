## Scientific Discovery and Knowledge Graphs

Hypotheses generation and testing in scientific research is often a time-intensive process. Researchers are now looking into making the process more reproducible and trustworthy, with the end goal of machine actionability – the ability of machines to discover knowledge with little human intervention. 

For this project, a MSc. student can focus on addressing one (or more) of the steps of hypothesis generation and testing for humanities or social science research: 

Dealing with observational data (as RDF Data Cubes):

- data and knowledge integration (discovering bias, automatically discovering ‘content gaps’)

Content gaps or bias in Scientific Knowledge Graphs (KGs) impact downstream applications, which is undesirable when used, for instance, for the discovery of novel facts or theories. In this project, the student would research methods for framing or measuring these gaps on an existing scientific KG in the context of user needs, for instance through user's natural language queries.

Automatically discovering interesting patterns (descriptive statistics) and their comparisons in RDF Data Cubes:  

- automated discovery of interesting aggregations (descriptive statistics) of observational data (RDF Data cubes)

Describing components of theories, and formalising theories from the literature
- n-ary relation extraction from articles: coming up with curation workflows or tools
N-ary relation extraction from unstructured text using LLMs is often error-prone, but can mitigate the labour of domain experts. In this project, the student is required to compare human-in-the-loop workflows for _curation_ of machine generated triples from unstructured text, or come up with a novel workflow themselves to be tested in a user study.
- n-ary relation extraction from articles: Using GPT and knowledge graphs to automatically annotate research papers.  Making the hypotheses, research questions, methods or results described in an academic paper machine readable is now mainly manual work.  Can we use smart prompt engineering and ask GPT to do this for us? (In collaboration with ODISSEI and Jacco van Ossenbruggen)
- integration of types of scientific knowledge, or cross-domain scientific data and knowledge integration 
- SHACL-forms: domain-agnostic automated creation of user forms from SHACL shapes for publishing structured research questions as RDF

Understanding (and towards automation of) the scientific process: 
- research how process ontologies of the scientific cycle can aid researchers
- a comparison of (RDF) vocabularies for describing the scientific process (supervisors: Lise & Ilaria) 
- a comparison of human-in-the-loop workflows of the scientific cycle that make use of Knowledge Graphs
