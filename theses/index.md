## Expectations
At KAI, we want to set clear expectations for students. At the same time we want to make sure students know what to expect from us as their supervisors. We have prepared a <a href="supervision_guidlines">short document</a> which touches upon some important points like meetings, planning and writing of your thesis. 

## VU Theses

Most of the topics below can be investigate by either BSc or MSc AI student but also by multiple students. We also welcome groups of students working on the same or similar topic. 

If you are interested in one of the projects below, please contact the supervisor(s) listed to receive more information about the topics. Where available have a look at the detailed description first. Also, keep in mind that most if not all theses can be shaped to accomodate your interests.

#### Ontology/Knowledge Graph Engineering and Evolution
*Supervisor: Romana Pernisch (r.pernisch@vu.nl)*

Ontologies model specific domains. As domains evolve over time, ontologies have to be changed as well. Not only are the ontologies themsevels affected but also applications using those ontologies for various purposes. We have multiple theses in this domain:

- **ChImp 2.0**: The ChImp Protégé plugin helps ontology engineers during this process by summarising and displaying changes and the effects of changes on the ontology as a whole. We have multiple possible projects with ChImp. More information is <a href='chimp'>here</a>.:
    -  Investigation of competency questions in the context of changing ontologies.
        - How can competency questions be updated as the ontology is edited?
        - How can we measure the impact of changes on the competency questions?
    - Implementation of session continuity.
    - Impact of importing ontologies within Protege:
        - How can we quantify the impact of the import of an ontology?
        - How can we quantify and display the impact of the changes of imported ontologies?

- **Materialisation**: We have previously investigated the impact on the materialisation (making implicit knowledge explicit) and want to further the analysis in these directions:
    - Investigate types of changes and their impact on the materialisation
    - ...

- **KG Embeddings**: We have previously evaluated the Embedding Resemblence Indicator using synthetically generated versions of two biomedical ontologies and the two benchmark datasets FB15k-237 and Wordnet-18-RR but only regarded deletions. With embeddings there are additional investigations to be made:
    - In-depth analysis/investigation of the influence on embedding by different types of changes
    - Evaluation of ERI on addition test cases (compared to deletion test cases) on synthetic data
    - Evaluation of ERI on real world data
    - Investigation of increment behaviour of ERI
    - Investigation into the estimation or approximation of ERI

<p>

**Requirements:**
- Students are expected to be at the office at least once a week on Thursdays. The CFLW office is at the Hague Security Delta, next to Laan van NOI railway station.
- Students must be technically skilled in computer science, artificial intelligence, digital technologies, forensics or any other related background.
- Students need to be intrinsically motivated to make cyberspace a little bit safer.

**Benefits:**
- Students will receive an internship fee.
- Students will learn how a startup works as they will take part in the company operations.
- They formulate student projects in a way so students can realize a real-world impact on security.
