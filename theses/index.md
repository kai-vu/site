## Expectations
At KAI, we want to set clear expectations for students. At the same time we want to make sure students know what to expect from us as their supervisors. We have prepared a <a href="supervision_guidlines">short document</a> which touches upon some important points like meetings, planning and writing of your thesis. 

## VU Theses

Most of the topics below can be investigate by either BSc or MSc AI student but also by multiple students. We also welcome groups of students working on the same or similar topic. 

If you are interested in one of the projects below, please contact the supervisor(s) listed to receive more information about the topics. Where available have a look at the detailed description first. Also, keep in mind that most if not all theses can be shaped to accomodate your interests.

#### Ontology/Knowledge Graph Engineering and Evolution
*Supervisor: Romana Pernisch (r.pernisch@vu.nl)*

Ontologies model specific domains. As domains evolve over time, ontologies have to be changed as well. Not only are the ontologies themsevels affected but also applications using those ontologies for various purposes. We have multiple theses in this domain.
- **ChImp 2.0**: The ChImp Protégé plugin helps ontology engineers during this process by summarising and displaying changes and the effects of changes on the ontology as a whole. We have multiple possible projects with ChImp. More information is <a href='RP_chimp'>here</a>.
- **Materialisation/Reasoning**: We have previously investigated the impact on the materialisation (making implicit knowledge explicit) and want to further the analysis by diving into more depth. This means that we want to investigate the types of changes in more detail but also the effect of the changes more localized in the materialisation, rather then looking at the materialisation as a whole.
- **Embeddings**: We have previously developed a methon to compare embeddings as the underlying knowledge graph changes. We want to further this method and analyse its capabilities in more detail. <a href='RP_eri'>here</a> is the thesis description.

There are other related topics in collaboration with companies, that are centered around ontology engineering or dealing with changing data (stream) in general. You can find more information further below on this page:

#### Information Extraction
*Supervisor: Benno Kruit, Ilaria Tiddi*

We offe multiple projects under the umbrella of information extraction with varying focus.
- **Automated Processing of Scholarly Data**: *(Ilaria)* The goal of this project is to support the automatisation of processing the <a href=""http://ceur-ws.org/>CEUR-WS proceedings</a> data. For a BSc thesis, the objective is to extract an ontology of CEUR knowledge. For a MSc thesis, this would be extended with analysing abstracts or creating an interface for data input and knowledge graph population.
- **Information extraction from Structured lists** (BSC, *Benno*)
- **Higher-arty Relation Extraction with Qualifiers** (MSc, *Benno*)
- **Multilingual Travel Knowledge Extraction** (MSc, *Benno*)

#### Argument Mining
*Supervisor: Loan Ho*
There are multiple project in the domain of argument mining with different objectives:
- **Argumentation-based explenation from KGs** (MSc): the goal is to run Tableau on an DL-formalised ontology.
- **Case-based reasoning in the legal domain** (BSc): the goal is to create an ontolog (DL-lite) for tabular data input and running the tableau algorithm to predict whether a case has a (non)violation. 


#### Narratives
*Supervisor: Lise Stork, Ilaria Tiddi*

What are narratives?
- **Identifying Formal Narrative from KGs**: The goal of this project is to extract as many narrative as possible (in terms of set of facts) from existing KGs such as DBpedia or Wikidata. In order collect these facts, we will use the narrative formal structure as presented in this <a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2969/paper31-CAOS.pdf">paper</a>.
- **A Benchmark for understanding Narratives**: Language Models and KGs. Work on extending the three existing benchmarks (<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7081522">1</a>,<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/7118556">2</a>,<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/7120502">3</a>) for understanding narratives.


#### Question Answering
*Supervisor: Benno Kruit*

- **Playing "20 Questions" with a KG** (BSc)
- **Multi-modal Question Answering** (MSc)
- **Graph Queries on Relation Databases** (MSc CS)


#### Multi-lingual problems
*Supervisor: Benno Kruit*

- **Multilingual entity Linking** (BSc)
- **Multilingual Travel Knowledge Extraction** (MSc)


#### Other
- Shopping Data Schema Induction (MSc, Benno)
- Analysing multi-task deep models with Graph Analysis: This is a collaboration with the Bioinformatics department.
- Incorporating Semantics in Message Passing methods

## Internships

#### Elsevier
*Supervisor: Romana Pernisch*

Elsevier is offering many theses, most of which are not listed here for now but will be added later.

#### CFLW Cyber Strategies
*Supervisor: Romana Pernisch*

CFLW is a tech startup from the Netherlands, founded at the end of 2019, based in The Hague. They develop intelligence services for law enforcement agencies, cybersecurity agencies and financial/fintech organizations. Their core product is Dark Web Monitor, which is used by various agencies around the world. For more details on CFLW see their <a href="https://cflw.com">website</a>

<summary>Internship details</summary>

**Requirements:**
- Students are expected to be at the office at least once a week on Thursdays. The CFLW office is at the Hague Security Delta, next to Laan van NOI railway station.
- Students must be technically skilled in computer science, artificial intelligence, digital technologies, forensics or any other related background.
- Students need to be intrinsically motivated to make cyberspace a little bit safer.

**Benefits:**
- Students will receive an internship fee.
- Students will learn how a startup works as they will take part in the company operations.
- They formulate student projects in a way so students can realize a real-world impact on security.

#### Lareb
*Supervisors: Romana Pernisch, Ilaria Tiddi*

Lareb is ??
The goal of this thesis is to extract and model the data of Lareb on drug reactions so that link prediction approach can be deployed over this data. Additionally there is also interest in aligning the extracted model with existing Knowledge Graphs on drugs.

#### Accenture
*Supervisor: Ilaria Tiddi*

#### Triply
*Supervisor: Ilaria Tiddi*

Triply is ??

There are several project available in collaboration with Triply on using Machine Learning and NLP over large scale KGs. Group work is possible and projects can be either BSc or MSc.
