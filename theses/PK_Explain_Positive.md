## Thesis title:  Explaining Entailments from Ontologies
*Supervisor: Patrick Koopmann (p.k.koopmann@vu.nl)*

Ontologies are an important representation formalism for symbolic AI
systems. Ontologies that are formulated in OWL allow to usage of
reasoning systems such as HermiT or ELK to infer implicit information
from an ontology, or from a dataset that is combined with the ontology.
Different to inferences performed by sub-symbolic AI systems,
decisions made by such a reasoner are in a way "explainable by
design", because all inferences can be explained solely based on the
information available in the ontology. However, in practice,
explanations provided to users by the state-of-the-art are not always
so easy to understand. Recently, we have been developing newer
techniques towards different types of explanations, that are supposed
to make reasoning with ontologies truly explainable in practice. In
this project, you will investigate alternative inference systems that
can be used to create better explanations. In particular, you will
develop a system of inference rules that can be used to produce more
user-friendly explanations.

The supervisor will give an introduction to the topic
(foundations of description logics, rule-based reasoning) at the
beginning of the project. To get an idea, you can consult the
following paper, that describes the current proof-based explanation
services in practice:

Don't be afraid to contact the supervisor if you would like to
have more information on this project or would like to discuss it in
more detail in person.
