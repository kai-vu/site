## Handling inconsistencies in argumentation knowledge 

*Supervisor: Loan Ho (t.t.l.ho@vu.nl)*


#### Why
In the legal domain (EU Convention of Human Rights), a problem is that a number of past decisions could be simply wrong because attitudes and case law change over time and later cases are preferred to older cases.  a decision in this case is still a challenge, especially in the case of  argumentation data. 

#### How 
In the thesis, we will address inconsistencies in argumentation data by using logic-based reasoning.

#### Who 
Supervision will be by Loan Ho and Stefan Schlobach.

#### Requirements
- Knowledge of graphs
