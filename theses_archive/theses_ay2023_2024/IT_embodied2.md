## Energy-efficient robots through knowledge-awareness
*Supervisor: Ilaria Tiddi (i.tiddi@vu.nl)*

#### Description
We have an ontology representing the capabilities of the robots (picking objects, moving, scanning surroundings, etc.). The ontology needs to be expanded with energy budgets so the robot can choose the actions to performed based on its capabilities and energy-efficiency. Collaboration with the Software Engineering group.

#### Requirements
- Knowledge of ontologies and ontology engineering
- Knowledge of ROS is a plus

#### Literature
- [An ontology-based approach to improve the accessibility of ROS-based robotic systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3148011.3148014)
