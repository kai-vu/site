## Answering Research Questions over Data Cubes as SQA
*Supervisor: Lise Stork (l.stork@vu.nl)*

#### Description
Hypotheses generation and testing in scientific research is often a time-intensive process. 
Researchers are now looking into making the process more reproducible and trustworthy, with the end goal of machine actionability – 
the ability of machines to discover knowledge with little human intervention.
For this project, students can focus on addressing one (or more) of the steps of hypothesis generation and testing for humanities or social science research.
