## Thesis title:  Extracting Sub-Ontologies
*Supervisor: Patrick Koopmann (p.k.koopmann@vu.nl)*

Ontologies are an important representation formalism for symbolic AI
systems. Ontologies that are formulated in OWL allow to usage of
reasoning systems such as HermiT or ELK to infer implicit information
from an ontology, or from a dataset that is combined with the ontology.
Modern ontologies are often very large, and can contain 10,000s and even
100,000s of statements, which makes it hard to handle them. In many
applications, not all of the content of an ontology is relevant, so
that it would make sense to extract a smaller ontology to use instead
of the original, large ontology. A subontology is a smaller and ideally
simpler ontology that covers all relevant information from the
ontology for a user-provided set of terms of interest. There are
different techniques (module extraction, uniform interpolation) that
can be used to extract subontologies. The aim of this project is to
investigate and evaluate heuristics to improve the performance of
these methods, or develop a new approach that works by combining them,
with the aim of obtaining simpler ontologies and/or shorter
computation times.   

The supervisor will give an introduction to the topic and the proposed
idea at the beginning of the project. 
You can contact the supervisor if you would like to
have more information on this project or would like to discuss it in
more detail in person.
