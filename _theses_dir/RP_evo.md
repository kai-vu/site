## Investigating Support for Ontology Evolution (multiple projects)
*Supervisor: Romana Pernisch (r.pernisch@vu.nl)*

#### Background
Ontologies are often engineered for a specific task and later updated as either the task or the modeled domain evolves. The changes to ontologies are therefore inevitable. In practice, ontologies are integrated in complex processes and require tool support at different stages of this process.

#### Description
In theses around this topic, students can investigate different aspects of ontology evolution in combintation with software tools. This means that the topic can be tailored to the individual student's interest.

This topic contains multiple thesis topics and these are the different parts that individual students can choose to work on:
- Survey and comparison of tools to support a portion of the process.
- Implementation of a change detection algorithm in phython or java.
- Implementation of an automation approach of a part of the process.
- Detection of missing concepts using NER (or other appoach).

#### Literature
Mandatory reading:
