## Possible applications of Alternating-time Temporal Epistemic Logic in AI
*Supervisor: Vera Stebletsova (v.n.stebletsova@vu.nl)*

#### Description
Possible topics/research questions to investigate
- What ATEL is (syntax, semantics, main features of its formal theory)
- Review applications of ATEL known in the relevant literature
- Construct an intelligent system (Multi-Agent System) which requires an extension of ATEL in order to specify and verify correctness properties of the constructed MAS.
