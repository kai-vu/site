#### Description

In this project, the goal is to work on developing a framework for knowledge-based adaptive robots working on long-horizon interactive tasks. From robot learning data and/ or robot experiential data, the student will populate robot episodic memories in the format of a time-indexed knowledge graph, and will develop a methodology for continuous robot introspection and self-adaptation. During the whole project development, the student will count on our expertise on applied ontology and knowledge graphs for robotics, and we will provide the student with a 'ready to use' framework for generating memories from robot data.
