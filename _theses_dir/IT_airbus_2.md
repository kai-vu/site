#### Description

_NOTE: This project is in Hamburg!_

Aircraft manufacturing remains largely reliant on manual labor, particularly when it comes to customization to meet specific airline requirements, which makes full automation of processes challenging with current technologies. However, human-centered technologies such as collaborative robotics could help automate certain tasks, easing the burden on human workers. For effective collaboration, the robot’s perception and mental model must be well-aligned with its environment. Clear explainability and interpretability of the robot’s actions are critical for the successful integration and application of these systems in the factory setting
