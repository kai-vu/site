## Thesis title:  Learning Concept Descriptions from Examples
*Supervisor: Patrick Koopmann (p.k.koopmann@vu.nl)*

The aim of this project is develop learning methods that can be used
to aid the development of ontologies that are based on OWL or
description logics. In particular, the problem to be solved can be
stated as follows: given a dataset with some objects marked as
positive and negative examples, find a logical description (using an
ontology language) that describes all of the positive and none of the
negative examples. While this sounds like a classical machine learning
problem, the aim is to use logic-based techniques to solve this
learning problem. For this, you will implement an further investigate
a new idea for learning concept descriptions, which will explore
recent tools for non-classical reasoning.

The supervisor will give an introduction to the topic and the proposed
idea at the beginning of the project. 
You can contact the supervisor if you would like to
have more information on this project or would like to discuss it in
more detail in person.
