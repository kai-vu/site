#### Background

Belief function theory is a framework to combine uncertain evidence and form rational belief based on such evidence. Over the years, this theory has been extended with multiple rules to combine evidence, which ensure rationality in a given context. In (Pinto Prieto et al., 2023), the authors proposed a framework that enables the definition of combination rules based on specific parameters, which allows for adopting combination rules from other frameworks as well as creating entirely new ones. While the source discusses the theoretical advantages of this approach, an experimental and systematic comparison among the rules remains an open issue.

#### Description

This project aims to explore the systematic comparison of combination rules for belief functions, including traditional and new rules. Some milestones of this project are: 

-	Getting familiar with belief function theory and evidence modal models. 
-	Getting familiar with the real bird dataset with uncertain values. 
-	Proposing and implementing a pipeline for the systematic comparison of rules of combination.
-	Extending the multi-layer belief model to enable the use of more general evidence as input. 

Depending on the student’s interests, the proportion between the theoretical and the practical parts of the thesis can vary.
