#### Background
*Give some background information*

Developing methods for aggregating uncertain information is a thriving area of research. Some of the questions we can investigate on this topic are: What are we uncertain about? How does uncertainty interact with other properties of information (such as consistency or relevance)? How do different aggregation methods behave in practice?

#### Potential projects:
- Compare different evidence combination rules on a relevant dataset focusing on those cases with mutually contradictory evidence.
- A literature review about epistemic and aleatory uncertainty in artificial intelligence. This review could be complemented with illustrative examples built on real-life data and a (non-extensive) review on computational methods to deal with these kinds of uncertainty.
