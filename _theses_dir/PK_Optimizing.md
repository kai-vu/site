## Thesis title:  Optimizing Concept Expressions
*Supervisor: Patrick Koopmann (p.k.koopmann@vu.nl)*

Ontologies often contain expressions that are more complex than
necessary. This is even more a problem with ontology content that is
automatically generated, which appears in many applications. The aim
of this project is to develop a method to optimize concept expressions
by replacing them by equivalent expressions that are of minimal
size. We recently developed a method that can do this for a language
of rather limited expressivity. The student will extend this
framework, possibly using techniques from concept learning.

The supervisor will give an introduction to the topic and the proposed
idea at the beginning of the project. 
You can contact the supervisor if you would like to
have more information on this project or would like to discuss it in
more detail in person.
