#### Description

_NOTE: This project is in Hamburg!_

Future aircrafts will feature increased automation to assist pilots in complex decision-making scenarios with the objective to reduce their workload during repetitive or simple tasks. These assistance systems will add an extra layer of redundancy, including the ability to monitor and detect the pilot’s cognitive state (e.g., workload, fatigue), thereby enhancing performance and improving efficiency in the cockpit. For these systems to be successfully certified and accepted by pilots, their actions must be transparent and explainable.
