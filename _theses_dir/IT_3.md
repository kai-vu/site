#### Description

We have an ontology representing knowledge about a robot operating a micro-surgery with a team of humans. The goal of the project can be 
- (a) improving the ontology to include fine-grained actions or 
- (b) implementing a web interface that uses the ontology and simulates the micro-surgery reasoning.
