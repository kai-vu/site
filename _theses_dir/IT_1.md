#### Description

Hybrid Intelligence aims at becoming a new science. As every science, it should rely on common assumptions, research questions, methods, metrics and principles. AI, Psychology and Human Computer Interaction are an example of ancestors disciplines of the Hybrid Intelligence science; for instance, HI inherits from AI the principle that "learning can be performed through searching in a space". This is a qualitative study, and the goal is to identify theories in disciplines that relate to HI, and map them to existing HI literature. Examples are: economics/econometrics (how to distribute work and resources), language and communication sciences, software engineering (explicitly instructing non-intelligent machines), sociology (teams, organisation and interaction between people), biology systems (adaptation, specialisation, ecosystems), movement sciences (including robotics/cybernetics) for physical cooperation, etc.
