#### Background

MWe talk about fault diagnosis in the context of cyber-physical systems. When a cyber-physical systems goes down, it is a big challenge to identify the root-cause of what is failing. Typically, companies offer diagnosis applications that assist the service engineers with identifying such root-cause. 

In this context, some sort of reasoning must be encoded into the diagnosis application, aiming to aggregating the available information about the system and its symptoms and providing with a solution. The use of modern formal logics for this application is rather uncommon, due to the open questions about computational complexity and implementation solutions. In this project, we want to explore the advantages of applying the epistemic modal logic to this problem, advancing the literature on the implementation side. 


#### Description

This project aims to explore the application of epistemic modal logic to the domain of fault diagnosis. To this end, the student will work with other students on the creation of a small dataset for fault diagnosis. Afterwards, the student will propose an end-to-end solution for fault diagnosis by applying epistemic modal logics. Some milestones of this project are: 

-	Creating (collaboratively) a (small) fault diagnosis dataset. 
-	Getting familiar with epistemic modal logic.
-	Identifying implementation software for applying epistemic modal logic. 
-	Proposing a pipeline to solve the fault diagnosis problems shown in the dataset by applying epistemic modal logic. 
-	Analyzing the obtained results. 

Notice that this project has a collaborative part with other BSc students.
