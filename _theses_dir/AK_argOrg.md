## Thesis title:  Discussion Games for Abstract Dialectical Frameworks
*Supervisor: Atefeh Keshavarzi(a.keshavarzi.zafarghandi@vu.nl)*

Abstract argumentation frameworks (AFs) are a widely used mathematical tool in non-monotonic reasoning. AFs are directed graphs where nodes represent arguments and edges represent a binary relation of attack between arguments. The question of which argument in an AF is believable (i.e., which arguments "win the discussion") can be answered by winning a two-player discussion game for a given argument. However, some applications involve additional relationships between arguments, such as one argument supporting another or attacks among sets of arguments. Abstract Dialectical Frameworks (ADFs) generalize AFs and can represent these relationships. We have recently developed two-player discussion games for ADFs. Several open problems remain, such as: How can they be implemented efficiently? What is their time complexity, i.e., how fast does the solver work? How do they perform on specific subclasses of ADFs? These are the focus of this project.
