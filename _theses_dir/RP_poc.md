#### Background
When ontologies and knowledge graphs are engineered, they capture the domain at a specific moment in time.
However, domains do not remain static and it is important to keep ontologies up to date.

#### Description
In this project, you will develop a theoretical framework for human-in-the-loop ontology updates. This means that the updates come in as a suggestion from an automated pipeline (bot) and a human needs to be able to interact and intervene before the update to the ontology is applied.

In the case of a MSc thesis, this project can be extended into different directions.
