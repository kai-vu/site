## Knowledge Engineering for Hybrid Intelligence 
*Supervisor: Ilaria Tiddi (i.tiddi@vu.nl)*

#### Description
Inspired by Software Design and Engineering, Knowledge Engineering deals with the formal design, maintainance and usage of knowledge-based systems. In this project, we will look at modelling Hybrid Intelligent systems using knowledge engineering techniques.

#### Requirements
- Knowledge of ontologies and ontology engineering

#### Literature
- [Knowledge Engineering for Hybrid Intelligence](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3587259.3627541)
