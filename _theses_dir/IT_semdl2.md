## Solving Math Word Problems with LLMs
*Supervisor: Ilaria Tiddi (i.tiddi@vu.nl)*

#### Description
Despite recent advancements in NLP, large language models cannot still solve Math World Problems (MWPs) with high accuracy. To tackle this challenge,
this project will look into (1) creating a Knowledge Graph of MWP, by designing the ontology and linking the existing dataset to Semantic Web resources, 
and (2) create a graph-to-text dataset for GNN training. 
Thereafter, either one can either work on new methods for solving these problems or on developing a benchmark for graph2text 
methods (by using the ability of LLMs to solve the generated MWP from the graph as accuracy metric).

#### Requirements
- Knowoledge of GNNs/LLMs
 
#### Literature
- [World Models for Math Story Problems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.04347.pdf)
