## Thesis title:  Automated Hypothesis Generation using ABox Abduction
*Supervisor: Patrick Koopmann (p.k.koopmann@vu.nl)*

This project looks at the following problem: we have an ontology, as
well as some data in the form of a knowledge graph of ABox. This
contains our background knowledge about some domain such as medicine,
or a context from robotics. We are then given a set of facts that do
not follow from what we know according to our background knowledge -
an observation that is somehow unexpected, for instance a description
of symptoms of a patient or of an unexpected situation encountered by
a robot. We then want to generate a hypothesis in the form of a set of
facts that would explain the observation if added to the background
knowledge. To avoid trivial answers, we assume that there is also a
special vocabulary for explanations provided. This means, we want to
compute a hypothesis that uses only terms from that vocabulary, but
may refer also to unknown objects. This problem is called
signature-based ABox abduction. The aim of this project is to develop
a new method for signature-based ABox abduction based on some recent
theoretical results of this problem.



The supervisor will give an introduction to the topic and the proposed
idea at the beginning of the project. 
You can contact the supervisor if you would like to
have more information on this project or would like to discuss it in
more detail in person.
