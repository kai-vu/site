# below are the old topic titles and desriptions
- name: Information Extraction
  description: 'We offer multiple projects under the umbrella of information extraction with varying foci. Information extraction focuses on generating structured data from unstructured inputs in an automated manner. The input as well as the output can vary based on the application or end usage of the extracted data.'
- name: Ontology Evolution
  description: 'Ontologies model specific domains. As domains evolve over time, ontologies have to be changed as well. Not only are the ontologies themsevels affected but also applications using those ontologies for various purposes. We have multiple theses in this domain.'
- name: Hybrid Intelligence
  description: ''
- name: Argument and Rule Mining
  description: 'Rule mining, similarly to information extraction, aims at finding structures. In this case, we want to learn rules that describe the data best to help us understand it better. There are multiple projects that involve rule mining:'
- name: Robotics and Knowledge Representation
  description: 'These projects look at the intersection of robotics and knowledge graphs. Knowledge of Robotic Operating System (ROS) is a plus:'
- name: Explanations and Narratives
  description: 'The following topics are aimed at providing a more human-like AI, by creating explanations or creating narratives.'
- name: Question Answering
  description: 'QA is a very broad topic. We, however, focus on QA over structured data in various forms:'
- name: Multi-lingual problems
  description: 'Even though these topics would also fit under different topics already discribed above, we wanted to highlight them as they are both addressing the problem of multiple languages in different tasks:'
- name: Semantics of Deep Learning Methods
  description: ''
- name: Systems of artificial intelligent agents
  description: ''
- name: Explanations for Ontologies
  description: 'We offer a range of projects around the topic of explanations for ontologies. We focus on ontologies based on description logics or OWL. A main advantage of formulating knowledge in such a formalism is that one can use a reasoner to derive implicit information. However, not always is the result of this reasoning process easy to understand: users might wonder why something was derived (explain positive entailment), or why something was not derived (explain negative entailments). Motivated by this, different methods have been developed to provide explanations for positive and negative entailments.'
- name: Other Topics on Ontologies and Description Logics
  description: 'We also offer some further thesis topics on ontologies and description logics. These topics are particularly interesting for students with an interest in ontologies and/or logics.'
