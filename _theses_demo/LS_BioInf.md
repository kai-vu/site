## Creating knowledge graphs for olfactory dysfunction and mental disorders 
*Supervisor: Lise Stork (l.stork@vu.nl)*

#### Description
Biomedical text mining has emerged as a powerful tool to build up knowledge graphs and guide us through the vast plethora of available scientific 
literature and medical records. In this MSc. project, we primarily aim at the construction of a knowledge graph for the understanding of the link between olfactory 
dysfunction and mental diseases. Project together with Halima Mouhib from the Bioinformatics group.
