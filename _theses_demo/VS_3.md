## Modeling Multi-Agent Systems with incomple information
*Supervisor: Vera Stebletsova (v.n.stebletsova@vu.nl)*

#### Description
Logics for specification of MAS with perfect information are relatively well studied. However, many issues regarding modeling, analysis, and reasoning about systems with incomplete information are barely touched. This regards e.g. axiomatisation of ATL with imperfect information. Moreover, to our best knowledge, no satisfiability-checking algorithms for any variant of ATL with imperfect information have been proposed. It is not even known whether the problem is decidable at all.
