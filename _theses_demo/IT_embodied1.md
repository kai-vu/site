## Embodied Instructable Agents 
*Supervisor: Ilaria Tiddi (i.tiddi@vu.nl)*

#### Description
The goal of this project is to integrate a Reinforment Learning model trained for trajectory/segmentation learning on an embodied Hybrid Intelligent agent (a ROS-operting robot).
#### Requirements
-  Knowledge of one between ROS, Reinforcement Learning and simulation environments is required.

#### Literature
