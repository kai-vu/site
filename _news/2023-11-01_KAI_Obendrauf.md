Hi! I’m Kai (they/them) and I am starting my PhD in AI for data stream under Patrick Koopmann and Jacopo Urbani. We aim to use Knowledge Representation to reason about temporal data streams and create models explaining our reasoning (eg why a certain event was or was not detected).  

I have already been at VU Amsterdam for a little while, having completed my masters of AI here, with a thesis about formalizing modal logics in Lean. I really appreciated the welcoming and collaborative atmosphere at VU Amsterdam during my studies so I’m very excited to be able to start my next step here.
