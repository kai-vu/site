My name is Pelletreau-Duris Tom. My passion for networks took me to an intellectual adventure lastly materialising in a PhD position at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Knowledge in Artificial Intelligence (KAI) and the Learning & Reasoning (L&R) group studies. My research aims at advancing XAI for NeuroSymbolic AI. I am specifically interested in graph machine learning and mechanistic interpretability. I believe fruitful outcomes emerge from the interaction between academic research and industrial specifications. I am collaborating with Canon Printing and Philips HealthCare.
