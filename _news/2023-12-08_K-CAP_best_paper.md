The paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3587259.3627541">“Knowledge Engineering for Hybrid Intelligence”</a> by Ilaria Tiddi, Victor de Boer (UCDS group at VU), Stefan Schlobach and André Meyer-Vitali (DFKI, Germany) received the best research paper award at the Knowledge Capture 2023 conference (<a href="https://www.k-cap.org/2023/">KCAP2023</a>), one of the two leading venues worldwide on Knowledge Engineering.
The paper investigates how classical Knowledge Engineering methods can be adapted for use in HI scenarios, and proposes a new ontology for HI knowledge roles, a set of HI tasks, and a repository for HI scenario’s, allowing reuse, validation and design of existing and new HI applications.
