**Sien Jansen**

Hi everyone! I am Sien Jansen and as of the first of December I joined the KAI group as a PhD student.
I completed my bachelor’s in Psychobiology at the University of Amsterdam, where I realised I wanted to do more with mathematics and programming. This led me to pursue a master’s in AI, where I was introduced to logic. I wrote my master’s thesis on multimodal logics for agent features in multi-agent systems.
My interest in logic, together with my personal passion for ethics, led me to this PhD, which focuses on combining deontic logic and description logic to formalise ethical criteria in AI systems.
In my free time I like to keep up with neuroscientific research, do pottery and enjoy sports such as climbing.
