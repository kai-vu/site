I have joined the VU as an assistant professor in the Knowledge and Artificial Intelligence group (KAI) lead by Dr. Stefan Schlobach. I will be conducting research and teaching on logic for artificial intelligence. My research focus is on description logics and related formalisms for specifying knowledge. More specifically, I am interested in analysing theoretical properties and developing practical methods for non-classical reasoning problems that have applications in artificial intelligence, with a recent focus on explainability. Prior to joining the VU, I was a post-doc at the Technische Universit√§t Dresden and at the University of Oxford, where I worked with Prof. Franz Baader and Dr. Nikitina Nadeschda. I did my PhD at The University of Manchester under the supervision of Dr. Renate Schmidt.
