**Tommaso Zendron**

Hello everyone, my name is Tommaso Zendron and on October the 1st I joined the KAI group as a PhD candidate. I’ve obtained my master’s degree in Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence at the University of Milan with a thesis titled “Advanced Repair Frameworks in Description Logics for AI System Optimization”. In this research, developed during a research visit at TU Dresden, I’ve designed a new interactive strategy for ontology debugging that does not require the computation of the whole set of justifications and diagnoses upfront. In particular, by using heuristics and merging interactive and automated computations, I have ensured that the repaired ontology retains the knowledge that’s relevant to the user. During my PhD I’ll keep working on Description Logics within the Hybrid Intelligence Center. Glad to be here, and let’s connect on Linkedin if you’re reading this!



**Xiaoshuang Yang**

Hi everyone! I'm Xiaoshuang and just started my PhD with Patrick. I obtained my bachelor degree in philosophy from Tsinghua University in 2022. Then, I completed my MSc degree in logic (logic and computation track) from University of Amsterdam in 2024. My main research interests lie in mathematical proofs, functional programming, automated reasoning and formal verification. For my Master thesis, I developed a sequent calculus prover in Haskell using the zipper, a family of data structures that enables fast navigation and local manipulation on trees. My PhD project with Patrick will mainly focus on developing procedures and tools for finding Craig interpolation in description logics.
In my leisure time, I enjoy swimming, weightlifting and Crossfit. Nice to meet you all!
