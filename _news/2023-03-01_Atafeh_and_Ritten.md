Hi everyone! My name is Ritten and I've recently finished my MSc. in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Groningen. As of this month, I started in the Knowledge and AI (KAI) group as a PhD student! My main focus will be on the Hybrid Explainable Workflows in Security and Threat Intelligence (HEWSTI) project, which is a collaboration between academic partners (University of Leiden, University of Delft) and public/private partners (TNO, Thales). My function within the project will involve designing the representation of uncertainty within the workflow, taking into account the provenance, inaccuracy and lack of quality of the data. Fabio Massacci is leading this project, together with Katja Tuma and Stefan Schlobach. The latter will also be my day-to-day supervisor.
