Hi, I am Giacomo and I have recently started my PhD in Knowledge in the KAI group and within the Hybrid Intelligence Consortium. 
I did my MsC in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bologna, with a thesis in cognitive modelling. In my PhD, I will now study the interaction between knowledge graphs and argumentation theory, and I am particularly interested in the possibility of using such tools for perceiving deceptive behavior. I am very excited about joining both the VU and the HI group, and I look forward to the chance of collaborating in such multidisciplinary environments!
