# ‘What to expect?’ -  MSc. & BSc. project supervision

#### Meetings
* Be prepared when going into a meeting with a supervisor. Make a list of questions you had/where you got stuck, and show clear examples. 
* Agenda & notes: take notes during meetings, and propose an agenda. 
* Getting feedback: If you would like feedback on a specific item, albeit a scientific experiment, a framework, or something that you have written, please send those at least two days before the meeting, so that the supervisor has time to read about that item. 

#### Communication
* Be clear about your expectations, and about what motivates you/what doesn’t
* Communicate clearly when you don’t understand something or don’t agree, remember that you are doing the coding and experimentation

#### Planning
* Make a plan for your work when you start, and also plan a moment to revise the planning.
* Check what you need to submit and when (for instance, handing in a project plan after one month)
* Supervision meetings can/should be used to discuss progress with respect to your planning. 
* If you have a date in mind for when you would like to graduate, keep track of that date by yourself. Remember that getting feedback and grading takes time. 
* Start with a small literature study by reading the recommended literature 

#### Method/experimentation
* If you want to communicate your idea with your supervisor, use figures/process diagrams to explain the workflow. This helps your supervisor understand what you are doing, and you can use these for your thesis too. 
* Start programming early on, and document everying you do!

#### Thesis writing
* Before you start writing, have a look at the writing tips document that you can find on the canvas page. 
* Before you start writing, discuss with your supervisor the structure that you have in mind, to avoid having to redo a lot of work. 
* Start writing early on, don’t wait until you have done all the experiments! Writing helps you structure and formalize your thinking and can give insights into the methodology as well as experimentation!

#### Grading
* Both the first reader (supervisor) as well as the second reader should have three weeks to read and grade the thesis.
