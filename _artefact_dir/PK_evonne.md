title: "EVONNE"

description: "Evonne is a powerful web application for explaining entailments from ontologies. These entailments are explained using proof trees, for which we offer a range of navigation possibilities to explore these inferences. This can be used to better understand reasoning result from an ontology, but it can also be used for teaching purposes (explaining how reasoning works), and for debugging (determining how an erroneous statement was derived). For the latter use case, we connect the proof visualization with a graph like visualization of a relevant fragment of the ontology, which allows to quickly localize axioms used in the proof and their role and impact within the greater context of the ontology. Evonne can also be used to compute diagnoses --- sets of axioms that need to be modified or removed in order to remove the entailment --- which are then shown together with their impact on other statements in the ontology. Evonne can be installed locally using docker, but also directly tried online."
