title: "Bridging Bots: From Perception to Action via Multimodal-LMs and Knowledge Graphs"

description: "This project explores how neural models and symbolic reasoning can be combined for service robots to interpret complex environments and plan actions. It integrates Webots simulations, natural language task descriptions, multimodal LLMs, and ontology-based reasoning. A runnable Jupyter notebook is available at https://github.com/kai-vu/euRobin/tree/main/august2025/scripts." # I need a max 50 word description
