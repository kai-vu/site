title: "GeMO - Extracting General Modules for ALC Ontologies"

description:  'This is a tool for extracting knowledge from an ontology that is relevant for a specified signature of concept and role names (classes and object properties). The term "general module" generalizes the notions of uniform interpolation and classical modules. In particular, given a signature and an ontology, GeMO computes a new ontology --- the general module --- that preserves all logical entailments of the ontology that can be expressed using only the names from that ontology. Different to a classical module, the general module does not have to be a subset of the ontology, but may contain axioms that are not in the original ontology, which can lead to more focussed results. However, different to a uniform interpolant, the general module may still contain names that are not in the specifed signature, which can lead to smaller axioms.:'
