title: "EVEE - Evincing Expressive DL Entailments"

description: "Evee is a Java library that comes with a collection of plugins for the OWL ontology editor Protege to explain inferences performed by a reasoner. To understand why something was derived through reasoning, Evee shows proofs with user-chosen level of detail. To understand why something was not derived by the reasoner, Evee can show counterexamples, and also propose axioms that would fix the missing entailment.
